TO DO
- sparse matrix for the laplacian and the scaling matrix
- get the normals with openMesh
- get the laplace bertrami operator - polymesh book
- improve scaling with area - cross product of vetors?

- H and K at each vertex -> principal components
- colour the vertices according to a gradient based on these values
